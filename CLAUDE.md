# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (Vite)
- `npm run build` - Create production build
- `npm run build:dev` - Create development build
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:run` - Run all tests once

### Common Development Tasks
- After making changes to TypeScript files, run `npm run lint` to ensure code quality
- The development server hot-reloads automatically when files change

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for the frontend
- **Vite** as the build tool and dev server
- **Zustand** for global state management (see `src/state/useGraphStore.ts`)
- **D3.js** for graph visualization and physics simulation
- **shadcn-ui** components (in `src/components/ui/`)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Supabase** for backend integration

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Graph State Management**: The entire graph state is managed through a Zustand store at `src/state/useGraphStore.ts`. This includes nodes, edges, selected items, appearance settings, and layout configurations.

2. **Graph Visualization**: The main graph rendering happens through D3.js integration:
   - Force simulation is managed in `src/hooks/useD3Force.ts`
   - SVG rendering logic is in `src/components/GraphCanvas.tsx`
   - Node and edge components handle individual element rendering

3. **Component Structure**:
   - Page components in `src/pages/` handle routing
   - Feature components are organized by function (Graph*, Node*, Edge*, *Panel)
   - Reusable UI components from shadcn-ui are in `src/components/ui/`

4. **Type System**: Comprehensive TypeScript types are defined in `src/types/`:
   - `graph.types.ts` - Core graph data structures
   - `appearance.types.ts` - Visual styling types
   - `panel.types.ts` - UI panel state types

5. **Data Flow**:
   - CSV files are uploaded through `UploadPanel`
   - Data is parsed and validated in `src/utils/csvParser.ts`
   - Graph state is updated via Zustand actions
   - D3.js force simulation runs continuously for layout
   - React components render based on state changes

### Important Files and Their Roles

- `src/App.tsx` - Sets up routing and global providers
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Main application page with all panels
- `src/components/GraphCanvas.tsx` - Core graph visualization component
- `src/state/useGraphStore.ts` - Central state management
- `src/hooks/useD3Force.ts` - D3.js force simulation logic
- `src/utils/csvParser.ts` - CSV parsing and validation
- `src/config/constants.ts` - Application-wide constants

### Path Aliases
The project uses TypeScript path aliases:
- `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

Example: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:

- **[Node Customization Guide](docs/node-customization.md)** - How to customize node appearance, sizes, icons, and colors
- **[Performance Optimization Guide](docs/performance-optimization.md)** - Techniques for handling large graphs efficiently
- **[Layout Algorithms Guide](docs/layouts.md)** - Description of available layouts and when to use them
- **[Test Data Generation Guide](docs/test-data-generation.md)** - How to generate and customize test data

### Quick Reference

#### Changing Node Sizes
- Use appearance settings: `size` property (in pixels)
- GraphNodeV2 & GraphD3Node: Default 38px diameter
- Borders: Use `borderEnabled`, `borderColor`, `borderWidth`
- All appearance settings are now fully respected

#### Performance Tips
- Use "Fast" layout for 5000+ nodes
- Viewport culling is automatic
- LOD rendering: icons hidden at zoom < 0.3
- Reduce edge density for better performance

#### Adding Icons
- Emoji icons: Edit `src/config/emojiIcons.ts`
- SVG icons: Add to icon registry
- Icon selection: Settings â†’ Icon Style

## Task Management

### Active Tasks
Detailed task lists are maintained in the `tasks/` directory:
- `tasks/01_refactoring.md` - Current refactoring to separate React and D3 concerns

### Development Workflow
**IMPORTANT**: After completing each logical block of work:
1. Run `npm run lint` to ensure code quality
2. Run `npm run test:run` to verify tests pass
3. Commit changes with a descriptive message
4. Push to the repository

This ensures:
- Work is saved incrementally
- Changes can be reverted if needed
- Progress is visible to all team members
- Code quality is maintained throughout

### Commit Guidelines
- Commit after each completed phase in task files
- Commit after implementing each major component
- Commit after fixing each significant bug
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages that reference the task

Example commit messages:
```
feat: Create portal infrastructure for React-D3 separation
fix: Resolve removeChild errors in GraphD3NodeMount
refactor: Update useD3SvgGraph to use event system
```
