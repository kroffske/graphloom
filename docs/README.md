## Quick Start

For most common tasks:

1. **Make nodes smaller/larger**: See [Node Customization Guide](node-customization.md#changing-node-sizes)
2. **Improve performance**: See [Performance Optimization Guide](performance-optimization.md#optimization-strategies-by-graph-size)
3. **Choose a layout**: See [Layout Algorithms Guide](layouts.md#layout-selection-strategy)
4. **Generate test data**: See [Test Data Generation Guide](test-data-generation.md#quick-start)
